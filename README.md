# Chalsa Field Report 2024–2025
**Department of Geology & Geophysics, IIT Kharagpur**

> Seven-day Himalayan fieldwork synthesis covering geomorphology, tectonics, and sedimentology in and around **Chalsa (West Bengal, India)**.

---

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains the Group–2 field report and supporting materials from a week-long expedition in the **foothills of the Eastern Himalayas**. The project integrates **clast counts, structural mapping, terrace logging, paleochannel reconstruction,** and **strain analysis** to interpret the interplay between **MBT**, **MCT**, active faulting, sediment transport, and evolving landforms.

**Supervisor:** Prof. *Saptarshi Dey*  
**Affiliation:** Department of Geology & Geophysics, IIT Kharagpur

## 🎯 Objectives
- Map and interpret key structural zones (**Main Boundary Thrust – MBT; Main Central Thrust – MCT**) and associated splays.
- Analyze **terrace stratigraphy**, **paleochannels**, and **braided to single-thread river transitions**.
- Quantify **sediment provenance** via **clast counts** (gneiss vs. quartzite indices from Higher vs. Lesser Himalayas).
- Document **syn-sedimentary deformation** (e.g., colluvial wedges), **unconformities**, and **knick points**.
- Infer stress regimes and deformation history from **faults, folds, joints**, and **boudinage**.

## 🧭 Study Area & Key Sites
- **Murti River** – Imbrication and clast composition indicating dominant **Higher Himalayan** gneissic input.
- **Neora River** – Terrace stratigraphy (T1–T4), flash-flood remnants, paleochannels, and river incision near the railway bridge.
- **Jaldhaka Tributary & Nadem Tea Estate** – Imbrication azimuths (rose diagram), terrace logs, cross-bedding, and anoxic marker beds.
- **Gorubathan** – MBT & MCT measurements; sheared gneiss/quartzite, chevron folds, and metamorphic grade variation.
- **Ramgarh Thrust** – Fault-propagation folding, isoclinal folds, milled rocks, thrust-related phyllites.
- **Piedmont Fan & Bhanga Pahar** – Episodic fan deposition, peat/organic layers, sharp unconformity, active knick point.
- **Day‑7 Fault Site(s)** – Rotated thrust geometry, antithetic faults, multi-directional crack sets, uplift–shortening–slip relations.

> Representative coordinates (WGS84) from selected sites include: **Murti River ~26°49′36″N, 88°49′40″E; Neora River ~26°52′45″N, 88°46′17″E; Jaldhaka trib. ~26°52′57″N, 88°42′52″E; Gorubathan ~27°04′40″N, 88°52′06″E.**

## 🧪 Methods & Field Protocols
- **Clast Count (3×3 m plots):** Identify/quantify index lithologies (quartzite ↔ Lesser Himalaya; gneiss/garnet ↔ Higher Himalaya).  
- **Structural Measurements:** Strike/dip, joint sets, shear indicators; stereonet-based synthesis.  
- **Sedimentological Logging:** Bedding, cross-bedding, imbrication, grain-size trends, matrix content, peat/organic horizons.  
- **Paleochannel Indicators:** Sand lenses, anoxic black layers (marker beds), terrace correlation.  
- **Stress/Strain Analysis:** Joint-plane acute-bisector (σ1), boudinage in hinge zones, fault-propagation folding.

## 🔍 Principal Findings
- **Provenance:** Greater **Higher Himalayan** contribution (gneissic/garnet-bearing clasts) vs. quartzitic Lesser Himalayan input.  
- **Hydrology & Hazards:** Evidence for **flash floods** and high-energy events; braided-to-single channel transitions; incision modulated by **Lane’s balance** (tool vs. cover effects).  
- **Tectonics:** Active deformation along **MBT/MCT/Ramgarh Thrust**; **colluvial wedges**, syn-sedimentary deformation, and **unconformities** defining episodic uplift and aggradation.  
- **Metamorphism:** South–north gradient from **low‑grade schists** to **garnet‑bearing gneiss**; chevron folds and micaceous intergrowths.  
- **Kinematics:** Uplift–shortening–slip relations consistent with rotated thrust geometries; historical **mega‑earthquake (~1100 yr BP)** and present-day **~8 mm/yr** slip inferred from regional studies and field context.
